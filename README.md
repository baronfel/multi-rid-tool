## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

.NET Tools are a useful way to distribute and use platform-independent executables. 
In .NET 10 we're adding a new way of packaging and using Tools that leans into platform-specificity. 
This can lead to smaller, faster, and more efficient tools that are tailored to the platform they run on, while still being easy to use and distribute.

This project is a demonstration of how to create a platform-specific .NET SDK Tool using the new features in .NET 10 preview 6. The tool uses [Spectre.Console][spectre] to echo back some input text as ASCII art.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* [.NET 10 preview 6 SDK][download-dotnet-10]


## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To use the tool, use the new `dnx` command to run the tool from the command line. This will download and run the latest version of the tool, which will echo back the input text as ASCII art.

```bash
> dnx toolsay "Hello, World!"
Tool package toolsay@1.0.0 will be downloaded from source <source>.

                                |/
```

## üöÄ Packaging <a name = "deployment"></a>

The framework-dependent version of the tool, which will run on any system that has .NET 10 preview 6 runtimes installed, can be packaged using the `dotnet pack` command on the `toolsay` project. This will create a NuGet package in `./artifacts/package` that can be distributed and installed using the `dnx` command. If you're testing the local build of the package, you can use the `--source` option to specify the local path to the package.

```bash
> dotnet pack toolsay

                                |/
```

This package can be pushed to NuGet.org or another package source for easier use.

## Variations <a name = "variations"></a>

This tool builds in several variations to demonstrate the options you have for creating tools.

The variations are:
* **framework-dependent, platform-agnostic**: This is the default variation, which will run on any system that has .NET 10 preview 6 runtimes installed. This is the way all .NET tools have been built in the past, and it will continue to work with the new `dnx` command. This will result in one tool package that can be used on any platform that supports .NET 10 preview 6.
* **framework-dependent, platform-specific**: This variation will run on any system that has .NET 10 preview 6 runtimes installed, but it will only run on the specific platform it was built for. This is useful for tools that need to use platform-specific features or libraries. This will result in multiple tool packages, one for each platform that is specified in the project file.
* **self-contained, platform-specific**: This variation will create a self-contained executable that includes the .NET runtime and all dependencies. This is useful for tools that need to run on systems that do not have .NET 10 preview 6 installed. This will result in multiple tool packages, one for each platform that is specified in the project file. In this mode, the tool packages may be fairly large.
* **trimmed, platform-specific**: This variation will create a self-contained executable that includes the .NET runtime and all dependencies, but it will also trim unused code to reduce the size of the executable. This is useful for tools that need to run on systems that do not have .NET 10 preview 6 installed, but also need to be as small as possible. This will result in multiple self-contained executables, one for each platform that is specified in the project file.
* **Ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled, platform-specific**: This variation will create a self-contained executable that is compiled ahead of time for the specific platform. This is useful for tools that need to run on systems that do not have .NET 10 preview 6 installed, but also need to have as little startup overhead as possible. This mode requires creating AOT'd tool packages for each platform that is specified in the project file. The AOT compilation process for .NET requires building on each destination platform, so this mode requires the use of a CI process like GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps to build the tool packages for each platform.
